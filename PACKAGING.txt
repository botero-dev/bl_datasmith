Blender Datasmith exporter packaging info
=========================================

The built package consists on the following:

* Blender plugin zip file, to be installed from the Blender settings menu.
* Blender plugin in a folder, to be copied to the Blender addons folder.
* Unreal plugin, in the "Plugins" folder, to be merged into an existing Unreal project.

TODO: see the package structure for the epic games posting, they compile the plugin themselves, so we don't need to compile it.
