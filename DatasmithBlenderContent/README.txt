Blender to Unreal Exporter via Datasmith format.
================================================

Thanks for your support.

This is the UE companion plugin to the Blender to Unreal Exporter addon.

This plugin exposes implementations of Blender material nodes and other features
to improve the quality when importing Datasmith scenes exported from Blender.

You can also use these nodes directly if desired.

This can be installed in two ways:

- You can copy the DatasmithBlenderContent folder into the "Plugins" folder
  inside your project. If this folder doesn't exist you can create it.

- You can copy this plugin into the Plugins folder of the Unreal Engine
  installation directory.

  If you install the plugin this way, you won't need to add it to the projects
  to enable it, but other people that work on the projects will need to install
  it into their engines as well.
