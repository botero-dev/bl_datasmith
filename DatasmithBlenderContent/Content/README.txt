Blender Datasmith export plugin
===============================

Thanks for trying out this new version of the plugin!
This is preview software, only for personal and testing use only.

Place the blender-datasmith-export folder in your blender/addons folder, or
add the blender-datasmith-export.zip file from the blender addons menu.

Add or merge the Plugins folder to an UE4 project before importing the
Datasmith file, also, make sure that the BlenderDatasmithAdditions plugin
is enabled in the UE4 plugins menu.
