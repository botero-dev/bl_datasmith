Blender to Unreal Exporter via Datasmith format.
================================================

Thanks for your support.

This is a Blender addon that lets you export to Datasmith format.

This can be installed in two ways:

- From the Blender settings, browse to the install UI and select the ZIP file
  that contains this and the other code (python) files.

- Copy the *folder* that holds these files from the ZIP to the directory where
  your Blender installation scans for addons (make sure it is inside the
  `addons` folder)

Then, search and enable from the addons list.
