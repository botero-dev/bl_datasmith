Blender to Unreal Exporter via Datasmith format.
================================================

This is a Blender add-on that lets you import and export to Datasmith format.

This can be installed in two ways:

- From the Blender settings, browse to the install UI and select the ZIP file
  that contains this and the other code (python) files.

- Copy the *folder* that holds these files from the ZIP to the directory where
  your Blender installation scans for add-ons (make sure it is inside the
  `add-ons` folder)

Then, search and enable "Unreal Datasmith" from the add-ons list.
