The contents of the `addons/bl_datasmith` directory are licensed under the
Affero GNU General Public License (AGPL). You will find a full copy of the
license in that folder and packaged distributions, but these are the main
takeaways:

- All kind of redistribution of the software should also redistribute the source
  code of the add-on and linked software.
- This also includes cases where the software is distributed by network usage.

The contents of the `ue_template/Plugins/DatasmithBlenderContent` directory are
licensed under the MIT License. You will find a copy of the license in the
directory and in packaged distributions. This is the important stuff:

- You should not misrepresent the origin of the plugin or claim it as yours.
- You should credit the usage of the plugin somewhere in your product.
- Software is provided as is, free of charge, under no warranty.

Some code in `ue_template/Plugins/DatasmithBlenderContent/Shaders` was adapted
from Blender sources into HLSL format for Unreal Engine. Blender source code is
GPL which means all the package should be licensed as GPL. If you can't abide to
GPL license I guess you could remove those files from the package. I am not sure
about this, I'm not a laywer.
